<h1>Inner Axis</h1>
<img src="images/inneraxis.png">
<p id="slogan">Inner Axis is about more than bodily fitness and health, it's about developing inner fitness as well, a fitness that makes you feel better, sleep better, and therefore function at a higher level in your relationships and life-mission. It is my conviction that our exercise regime should be the embodying element of our highest ideal of life, or spirituality. <em>Then it empowers you to achieve not only optimum health, but also happiness and meaning</em>.
