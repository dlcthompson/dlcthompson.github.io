		<h1>Inner Axis</h1>
		<p>Inner Axis is about more than bodily fitness and health, itâ€™s about developing inner fitness as well, a fitness that makes you feel better, sleep better, and therefore function at a higher level in your relationships and life-mission. It is my conviction that our exercise regime should be the embodying element of our highest ideal of life, or spirituality. Then it empowers you to achieve not only optimum health, but also happiness and meaning. Inner Axis, is a system of field-tested skills and techniques that get immediate results. It includes a philosophy for real world living, breath-work, yoga movement, and meditation.</p>
